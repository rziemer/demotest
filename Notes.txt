Update package.json to replace line 14 with:
     "morgan": "~1.9.0",
This is an old version of Morgan and dependabot will find it and update the dependency.

Start with the basic EchoPost app without delete all and without the update functionality -- just add and delete.
Have a dev branch with a broken update function
Have a code branch that has the correct updates for the update function in it
Have two errors -- one preventing build, and another that crashes on runtime
Have the code branch also contain all the code for the delete all function
